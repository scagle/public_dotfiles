= Control Unit Design = 
    - MAR = Memory Address Register
        - Tells the Memory what address to grab data from
    - MAR = Memory Data Register
        - Memory Data I/O Register

He wants the RTL in this form:
Clock Cycle |   RTL         | Description   | Control Signals
______________________________________________________
1           | A <- RF[RS]   | ...           |   ...
2           |  ...          | ...           |   ...
