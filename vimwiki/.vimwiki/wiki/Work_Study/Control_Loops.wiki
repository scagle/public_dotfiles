Control Objective: Maintain x no matter what
Process Variable: Variable that is to be processed

Plant = Two Blocks = Actuator and Process
- Actuators aren't perfect.
    - They encounter Backlash, rate constraints, saturation
- 

    Proportional Controller ---+      [       Plant       ]
    Integral Controller -------|----> Actuator ----> Process
    Derivative Controller -----+
