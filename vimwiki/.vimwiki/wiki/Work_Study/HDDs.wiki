* Platter:
    * Magnetic disk that holds the information. Usually two sided
    * Surface is a surface of the platter
* Spindle:
    * The center of the circle that hold and spin the platters together
* Head:
    * Tiny magnet used to read and write data from the platters
* Track:
    * A circle path that a head can take on a platter. Many many many concentric circles on a platter.
    * Sector:
        * An arc of a track that contains header, data, and data recovery information
* Cylinder:
    * A vertical set of parallel tracks ( all tracks in which are readable by the N number of heads )


Parameters:
    * # of Cylinders = # of tracks surface/platter
    * # of Tracks per Cylinder => (# of read/write heads) or (# of platters * 2)
    * # of Sectors per track 
    * # of Bytes per sector 
Disk Capacity can be calculated based on above information

Step 1: Which is the appropriate cylinder
     Seek Time = Time for head to reach the right cylinder 
  +  Rotational Delay = Time for Sector to reach head
  --------------------------------------------------------
      Access Time
  +   Read Time: time to read one sector (once it is placed under head)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      Transfer Time
      
IE: If Rotation Speed is 3600 RPM
    ( ( 1 / 3600 ) * 60 sec/min ) / 2 = Average Rotational Delay
    = 8.32ms
