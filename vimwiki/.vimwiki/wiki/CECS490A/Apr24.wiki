= Final Report =
    * Grading guideline on the website
    * Gantt Charts
        * We will have to have one in report
    * 2 Submissions
        * Team Report
        * Individual Report
            * 2-3 Paragraphs 1 page
            * Not double spaced
            * Work that you did, work that they did, etc.
            * Confidential
    * Team Report Breakdown: _*Order doesn't really matter here*_
        * Lots of things carried over from midterm report
            * Name, etc.
        * Project Implementation
            * Go into more detail compared to last time.
            * All holes should be answered
            * Plausible mechanism for solving problems
        * Subcomponent Descriptions
            * Understanding functionality of subcomponent
                * IE: Bluetooth functionality, H-Bridge functionality, Stepper Controller functionality
                * Data Sheets
                * Understanding PWM / Duty Cycles / High Low Voltage / Direction
                * Really take the time to detail each component you're using and how they work
            * It's the only way Hernandez knows we know what we're working with as apposed to just grabbing stuff online 
            * EX: He had a report that was sparse and C at best
                * They met all requirements of the final report
                * But they had like 1 sentence for the subcomponent descriptions, which was not good
                * So take time here to incorporate all important concepts
        * Overall System Functional Block Diagram or Diagrams
            * Block diagram is pretty similar to previous overall block system diagram
            * Showing each connection between modules
            * Each module has a diagram that labels every single pin (GPIO, ANALOG IN, PWM, etc)
            * Voltage level table
            * Current Requirements (If a component is sinking like 1 Amp, you'll want to know that)
                * If there's a high impedance something, then you can get away with <1mA
        * Complete Schematic
            * Designed in a schematic program
            * He wants a COMPLETE schematic, of pretty much everything
            * BAD EXAMPLE: A lot of times he end's up seeing a schematic for one part in particular, and it's not enough
            * EX: If you purchase a BNO055 you'll get a development board, not just the chip
                * Other manufacturers have made the development board for it
                * We wouldn't need to remake the entire schematic for the BNO055
                    * We would only need to put the part in with its connections
                * However we will need to include the full schematic of the external parts as a reference
            * HOWEVER, we must include a schematic of the microcontroller or FPGA in our full schematic
                * Look up schematic for TM4C123G launchpad
                    * We need the bare minimum for the TM4C123G microcontroller. We don't need everything
                    * IE: JTAG for programming, Reset circuit, Crystal Oscillator circuit, decoupling caps, power, etc.
                    * *Only need to use the minimum necessary components for a functioning TM4C*
        * Power Management
            * Everything that's needed for power
            * Power Supply
            * Battery discharge chart, minimum amount before power supply cuts off
        * Circuit Simulations and Verification
            * We will need some stuff to build confidence in our design, and that it will actually work
            * Circuit verification
            * Software verification
            * Simulate in proper circuit modeling software
            * We will want a couple of these in report at end
                * Screen shots of simulations
                * Pictures of operation
            * If you're having trouble with finding things to verify, then contact Hernandez and he'll help out
        * Grading guidelines
            * Things that are not right, complete, or missing entirely will screw us over
