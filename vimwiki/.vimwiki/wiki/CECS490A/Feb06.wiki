= Types of connections =
    * Breadboard
        * Great for prototyping, not great for final products
    * Point-Point Soldering
        * Perfboard/Protoboard
        * VectorBoard
    * Through hole 
        * Components that fit through a pcb and are soldered on the other side
    * Surface mounted devices
        * Useful and very small
    * Wirewrapping
        * Tight connections in small space, but a little effort
    * PCB - Printed circuit board
        * Final designs, expensive, but super solid/compact/professional

= Circuit Board Design =
    * In our projects, in our reports, we need a schematic
        * People in the past have tried LTSpice
            * This is more for simulation and modeling
            * For modeling circuits and verifying that they are going to work
        * PCB Creation Software
            * For documenting a schematic
            * For multiple engineers to look at the same documentation
            * For reports
            * For eventually creating a circuit board
            * Groups:
                * Hobbyist
                    * Kicad
                    * Eagle (used to be professional, now on it's way out)
                    * EasyPCB123 (horrible according to eric hernandez
                * Professional
                    * Orcad 
                        * Great
                        * Older clunky interface
                        * Libraries are going to have outdated parts
                        * You might need to create components like tm4c1233gh6pm
                        * You can import libraries, but:
                            * because orcad libraries are professional, they have mostly industry parts
                    * Mentor Graphics
                        * Staple that has been around for so long
                        * Ugly interface
                        * Old engineers don't want to change
                        * But backend is amazing 
                            * Can find a TON of issues in the pcb design
                            * Has great algorithms to find problems
                    * Altium
                        * Easy interface 
                        * Easy to use
                        * Pretty good library
                        * Expensive
                        * Kind've an Apple company where they don't listen to userbase
                    * Altium/Circuit Maker
                        * Circuit maker is the free version of Altium essentially
                        * Pretty darn good
                        * Has a couple caveats
                            * Public domain designs, nothing is private
        * PCB Creation Steps
            * Schematic Entry
                * After schematic you take that design and turn it into a physical representation of your pcb
            * Layout + Routing
            * Generate Output
            * Gerbers
                * Gerber -> PCB fabrication house -> your home in 2 weeks as blank pcb
            * Soldering components to blank pcb
