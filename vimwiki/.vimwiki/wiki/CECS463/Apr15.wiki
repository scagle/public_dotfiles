    * Slide 12: Important properties of z-transform *WE DO NOT HAVE TO MEMORIZE*
    * Slide 17: Important pairs of the z-transform *WE DO NOT HAVE TO MEMORIZE*
    * Z-Transform and inverse of Z-Transform
        * Look at it by inspection
            * "Hey look at that, this looks like some formula we have"
            * or
        * *Partial Fraction*
            * z-transforms are most likely going to be in partial fractions in dsp
            * if you are going to do this outside of dsp class, then you wont go far with this
        * Hard more formal:
            * too much work for us for now
            * don't worry about it too much
    * Partial Fraction method
        * any kind of rational function can be expressed as a partial fraction expansion
        * I think it means split up fraction so that the numerator will be smaller than denominator (with a polynomial function on the side), so z-transform can take place
        * We either have a fraction already, or we want one so we massage it a bit
    * Inverse z-transform example 
        * We don't need to memorize each and every step of the process, but it will likely be a matlab problem with some matlab functions
        * He just wants to show us the process
    * Matlab implementation
        * [R, p, c] = residuez(b, a);
        * [b, a] = residuez(R, p, C);
        *
