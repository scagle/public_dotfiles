    * Network - An arrangement fo fabric of parallel wires, threads, etc. crossed at intervals by others fastened to them so as to leave open spaces; netting; mesh
    * Computer network - A collection of computers interconnected via a transmission medium (eg. copper wire)The computers can be a special or general purpose programmable hardware devices
    * LAN (Local Area Network)
        * Examples: Ethernet, Wifi, etc
        * Definition: A LAN is a network that covers a relatively small area (IE: a home or business) usually characterized by high-speed transmission and primarily connected by swithces. A LAN is  ...
    * WAN ( Wide area network) 
        * Examples: The internet, a tier 1 provider network (AT&T, Sprint, etc)
        * Def: WAN network is a network that typically covers large distances (100+ miles) and utilize leased telecommunication lines to interconnect switches/routers. 
        * Others: Phone (POTS), cell phone networks, Cable TV network, Satellite, Metropolitan-AN, System-AN, Personal-AN (IE: Bluetooth), etc
    * Why use Networks?
        * Availability of Resources
            * Makes resources available to anyone on a network regardless of the physical location of the resource or the user
        * Load Sharing
            * Process a job on the least crowded (or busy) machine
        * High reliability
            * Have alternate sources of resources
        * Human-to-human communication 
            * Allow humans to communicate through email, telephone, teleconferencing, etc
    * Why WAN's
        * Driving force: The need for government and university researchers located in various parts of the US to communicate ideas and data between computers
        * Beginning of the Internet: ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network)
            * Created in the early seventies

        * Evolution of the LAN's 
            * Sneaker Net -> Data Switches -> Disk  Servers -> File Servers
            * Sneaker Net - Have people literally in sneakers to run papers around a building
            * Data Switches - Electronic Device connected departments, and are able to instantly move information
            * Disk Server - Central tape-drive hub for everyone to store massive amounts of stuff (Floppy Disks / Tape Drives / etc)
            * File Servers 
                * A Company can access information together simutaneously entirely digitally
                * Distributed File Servers - Many companies can access information together
        * Programmable Evolution:
            * Stand Alone Apps -> Client-Server apps -> Distributed Systems -> Cloud Computing
    * Growth of the Internet
        * The internet has grown from a research prototype to a global communication system
        * The Internet has experienced exponential growth over many years

        * Two Types of Network Links:
            * Point to Point (or store and forward)
                * allow a single node to access a medium
            * Multiple Access 
                * allow more than two nodes to share a single physical medium
                * (Ethernet busses, etc)
        * Transmission Media: builds a physical link between nodes
            * Guided Transmission (copper wires, coax, fiber)
            * Unguided Transmission (infrared, laser, terrestrial radio, satellite)
        * Transmission Mode: is the manner in which data is sent over the underlyting medium
        * Parallel Transmission (sends multiple bits at a time, wired comm)
        * Serial Transmission (Sends one bit at a time, multiple transmission mechanism)
    * Two types of switched networks
        * Circuit Switched, ONLY over point-to-point links
        * Packet Switched, over point-to-point AND multiple access links
