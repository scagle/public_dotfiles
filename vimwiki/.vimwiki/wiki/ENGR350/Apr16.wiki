        * Rights and freedoms

        * Telecommunications act of 1996
        * US stopped passing laws in around 2005

        * Lots of lawmakers didn't really know what they were doing
        * Net Neutrality
            * We had it... Then not... Then did it again... Now we don't

        * Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect Intellectual Property Act - SOPA & PIPA
            * These laws were never passed in the US

    * What is the European Union?
        * EU - General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR (2018)
            * Puts regulations on companies and organizations holding the personal data of any EU citizen
            * Applies regardless of the company/organization's location

        * But, that isn't really practical for most companies... What, is Google just gonna block 433 million users?
