= The Digital Divide =
    * Evaluating and controlling trends in technology
    * Information, Knowledge and judgment
        * Should we just trust expert information or wisdom of the crowd" judgement when we see it?
        * The Web is filled with false information (medical treatment, HIstorical refernece, financial dvice, political information
        * Search engines generally help us find content - but web sites are ranked by popularity, not by expert evaluation
    * How does google show you results
        * Popularity contest
        * Advertisements
        * Things you've looked up in the past
    * Wikipedia
        *  Written by volunteers, so some posts are biased or inaccurate
        * Anyone can contribute, but most choose not to
        * Those that do write are generally not educated in the field, but consider themselves experts, of some sort
        * References don't always checkout
    * "Wisdom of the Crowd"
        * Problems with unreliable information are not new
        * the web seems to magnify those problems
        * SEO algorithms dont take truth into consideration
        * Site operators are respponsible for evaluating information submitted on their sites
            *  But this costs time and money and seems to be becoming lelss important... 
              (generally, our society has held that the more information we have online, the better)
    == Vulnerable Viewers ==
        * Who is a vulnerable viewer online?
            * Children - should be protected from certain content
            * Old People - the targets of many scam attempts
            * Less educated individuals - we're not speaking to overall education level, but knowledge about a specific topic
            * Anyone who will misinterpret information atleast one time (so in a sense, everyone is vulnerable)
        * Computers and commmunity
            * the WWW brings folks together from everywhwer
            * Email and the WWW provide quick and cheap ways to stay in contact
            * Social networking now allows deep insight into personal lives
            * Our communities have become somewhat gloablized
    * So what does this all mean?
        * It means the world is getting smaller
    == * Digitial divide : ==
        * Used to refer to the separation of those who had access to tech and didnt
        * Now it speaks to the gap between those who have access to tech and the knowldge of how to interpret information and theose who dont
            * Access and knowledge speak to:
                * The know-how to use any technology
                * the ability (phyiscal or otherwise) to use that technology
                * A basic understanding of how to protect oneself online
                * An ability to indentify content that is not trustworthy
        * Your textbook makes a great distinction with this:
            * Well there seems to be a :Lamborghini Divide" in the US - I don't have one, and others do
            * This divide really isn't the same as the Digital Divide:
                * Owning a nice car doesn't give someone an advantage over others in the same way that access to the WWW does (there are sevices that replace cars)
                    * The WWW gives us access to education, access to make informed decisions, access to communication, or to oversee our information
                    * If we didn''t have access to the internet, what service would replace those things?
        * Image Manipulation and the Digital Divide
            * We can easily see an influence on the digital divide when we look closely at image manipulation as a medium
                * Regarding:
                    * Movies and videos with incredibl special effects
                * But people use this for deception and fraud:
                    * This sometimes happens without malicious intentions:
                        * Sometimes the diff between entertainment and deception isn't obvious
            * Lets take a look at soome examples
                * (pictures in lecture that shows deception)
