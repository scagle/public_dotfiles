= General ethical principles and theories already applicable to IoT = 
    * The IoT Revolution
        * Blends together physical, biological, and Cyber worlds.
        * Tremendous impact on the way we live, and even our individual rights
    * Most glaring ethical issue is privacy and security.
        * Corporate Ethics:
            * Who's accountable for privacy/security problems with IoT devices? Individual or manufacturer?
            * Cheaper IoT devices wont have great security
        * Consumer Ethics
            * Should we spend on more secure, less functional IoT devices, or less secure, more functional IoT devices?
            * Do we care? So what if our informational privacy is violated? So what if hackers can control our house's temperature?
            * We should care, because IoT devices will get more sophisticated in the future.
            * We should instill a security minded culture around IoT devices, as these are the most personal devices we've seen so far.
    * There are some great applications to Internet of Things
        * I would argue that IoT does more good than bad from an ethical perspective
    * Since Internet of Things is becoming a more popular topic, it's also becoming more dangerous.
        * More less-technologically savvy people will start using IoT 
        * Often times IoT devices ship with default user names/passwords, which are susceptible to attack
        * Some examples of malware that specifically attack IoT devices include Mirai
    * Accessibility Privacy
        * Companies are obliged to protect user's privacy and data through use of good business practices
        * It would be unethical to put security on the back burner, as many consumers don't know how to protect themselves
    * IoT is a huge Policy Vacuum
        * There's not many laws that deal with IoT devices
    * Ethics of IoT is super important for public and private life
        * An important aspect highlighted by Nissenbaum (2015) is that privacy protection should be related to the “context” where the user operates. 
= Final Outline =
    1. Why an ethics perspective on IoT is important
        1. New technology = New ethical situations to consider
        2. As IoT technology grows, potential harm caused by exploitation increases
            1. More vulnerable consumers as market diversifies
            2. Most likely everyone will be affected in some way or another
        3. Security and Privacy concerns over mass-scale integration of IoT devices is a huge burden to carry as a company
            1. Trusting IoT corporations to make the right decision for us might be a bad idea.

    2. Major Ethical Issues
        1. There's no economic incentive to protect user data
            1. Why make a secure IoT device, when that just runs up the cost?
            2. Only pressure is consumers, who might not want what's in their best interest
        2. 
// Might not be best idea, since solutions might be discussed somewhere else
    3. Solutions to Ethical Problems
        1. Government intervention
            1. Laws
        2. Regulations / Self-regulations
        3. 

Having every all the devices around us be connected together seamlessly is a massive weight to carry as a IoT developer.
Without extensive standards and regulations to adhere to, companies have to navigate these new dangerous waters carefully.
