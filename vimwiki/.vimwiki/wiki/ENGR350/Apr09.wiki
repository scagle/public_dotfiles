= ALL OF US ARE PROFESSIONALS =
    *   All of us
        * We'll be working with data that can potent violate norm priv
        * We'll be dealing with sys that the masses rely on to store personal data
        * Some of us will manage systems that speak directly to the safely of theose using them.
    * We'll be responsible for building, maintaining, and supporting systems that people rely on 
= 3 Types of Errors and Failures =
    * (Order matters, snowball affect) 
    1. problems for individuals
        * Professional errors that incovienience individ or groups of individuals
        * Generally, these are the least severe types of errors, though they can have lasting Affects
            * People who recieve false bills online.
            * Those who have incorrect data collected and stored in a database, sometimes without their knowledge.
            * Those who have inheritied a false sense of reality, based on their online habits.
            * Many problems for individuals can cause major damages - and often violate Normative Privacy or Positive Rights
                * Social media platforms that don't allow people to control their own data
                * Swatting... 'nuff said!
                * Data mishaps (data that is wrongly merged or associated with unrelated data)
               
            * It is virtually impossible to produce a major program or system with absolutely no problems
            * And sometimes these problems can affect many peoples and can be hard to fix
            * What are our professional responsibilites when we cause Problems for Individuals?
    2. system failures
        * Professional errors that cuase either parital or complete failures and can't be fixed
        * Some system failures stem simply from a lack of testing a system before implementation
            * $125 million Mars Climate Orivter (1999) disappeared when it should have gone into orbit around Mars - Metric/International vs Imperial/US Units
            * In April 2014 hundreds of LAX flights were cancelled due to a computer bug that crashed all air-traffic monitoring systems
        * Some system errors happen simply because of increased user load without testing
            * American Express lost its credit card verif system during the holiday season in 2010 and MasterCard in 2013 - all the security calls for verif overwhelmed the system
            * Skype went offline for 2 days for 2007 - many users rebooted their systems at the same time after an automatic Microsoft Windows update was pushed
        * It is estimated that between 15% and 25% of cybertech projects are completely abandoned either just before delivery or soon after launch
        * Why?
            * Lack of clear, defined goals and how to accomplish them
            * Poor communication and management between groups
            * Use of untested technology with unknown reliability
            * Scope-creep after work begins
            * Overconfidence in the technology itself
        * Far-reaching effects can often leads to trouble with other connected systems - Mars Orbiter had a 2nd spacecraft that was rendered useless
        * Some system failures result from the use of Legacy Systems which don't play nicely with updated ones
        * What are our professional responsibilities when we cause System Failures (discuss)
    3. Safety-Critical Failures
        * Professional errors that have the potential to injure or kill people
        * Usually safety-critical failures are met with legal ramifications that follow the respobisible party for a long time
            * Nuclear reactors and other potentially polluting agents
            * Tesla crash in Florida, due to hacking the car
            * Hospital in Colorado shut down for 10 days due to faulty Electronic Health Record system
        * Obviously, damages caused by Safety-Critical Failures can never be fuly recovered
        * The best way to prevent them is to build fail-safe mechanisms into the project
        * Let's take a close look at an example:
            * Boeing 737 Max 8 Jet
                * 2 new planes crashed within 5 months, killing 346 people
                * A software issue would not allow pilots to override the fly-by-wire autopilot system during critical points in flight, and some safety systems seem to have been overlooked
                * Pilots were not trained well enough to understand this limitation
                * There is still no software fix - but all of these jets have been grounded
                * However, Boeing is still making these planes
            * Where were the problems in the Boeing 737 Max 8
                * It looks like Boeing was putting profit margins over safety, as the company may have known about these issues
                * Trained pilots using IPads and simple programs, rather than experience
                * Larger engines needed to be relocated on the plane, and software was s ...
            * So who is at fault for these crashes?
                * The Pilots
                * The Trainers
                * The Manufacturer
                * The Software Programmers
            * Distinguishing Fault - 3 Types
                * Responsibility
                    * Mostly individual fault
                    * You accidentally screw up
                    * Individual Guilt
                    * Usually no legal punishment
                * Liability
                    * Mostly Team Fault
                    * Your team pushes production code that causes all customers to lose stored information
                    * Shared Guilt
                    * Usually is some form of legal punishment
                * Accountability
                    * Corporate/Team Fault
                    * Your team designed a vehicle without a fail-safe system in place (you need to answer for it)
                    * Shared Guilt
                    * Always lots of legal punishment
* Great - How do we avoid all of this?
    * *Before a project gets underway, we must first assess the social, political, and ethical risk involved throughout the life of any project*
    * Risk Assessment
        * Two Groups are usually given the chance to assess the risk of any project
        * Engineers, Manufacturers, and Developers
        * Customers (or, at least, a customer sample)
