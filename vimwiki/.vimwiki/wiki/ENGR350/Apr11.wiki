= Outsourcing, offshoring, onshoring =
    * Fears of Technology
        * The intro of comps in the workplace generated many fears
            * Mass unemployment due to increased efficiency
            * The need for increased skill and trainig widens the earning gap, leaving the unskilled few choices
        * Newer trends still generates fears
            * Offshoring of jobs will lead to mass domestic unemployment
            * Employers use of technology to monitor their employees
            * ........?
    * Outsourcing:
        * When one company pays another company to do stuff/make stuff instead of doing those tasks itself
        * The US Outsourced 12% of all technology jobs in 2017
        * in 2007, 54% of tech CEO's questioned openly admitted to outsourcing a major part of their business
            * Now, 38% admit to it
        * Examples of Outsourcing
            * General Motors (us company) can outsource production of a car part to a German company
                * That German company can then outsource production of that part's components to another German company (those companaies manage their own internal business practices)
            * A California-based software company can outsource the manufacturing of computer components to a factory in China
                * That China-based comp oversees the hiring of its own employees in order to fulfill the order from California. The California company does not hire recruit or manage anything at the factory
            * Moral: *Outsourcing doesn't have to be overseas, but it certainly can be.*
    * Offshoring - The practice of moving self-managed business processes or services to another country, or employing an intermediary that you manage
        * In 2003, the US offshored 3% of all tec jobs
        * By 2015, .......... it went up
        * In general offshoring is getting more popular
        * Examples
            * General Motors (a US company) opens a factory in China and manages internal production of a car part at that location. They oversee hiring, management and daily operationsGeneral Motors (a US company) opens a factory in China and manages internal production of a car part at that location. They oversee hiring, management and daily operationsGeneral Motors (a US company) opens a factory in China and manages internal production of a car part at that location. They oversee hiring, management and daily operationsGeneral Motors (a US company) opens a factory in China and manages internal production of a car part at that location. They oversee hiring, management and daily operations.
                * In this case, the American Company still runs all production and business practices, and continues to operate as they would in the US
            * Norwegian Cruise Lines
                * Abuses the crap of of avoiding regulation by going between Panama and Miami
        * Moral: *Offshoring needs to happen in a different country*
        * Benefits:
            * Reduced cost to company (but, many companies don't invest cost savings back into their business or society... they pad thier pockets)
            * Ability to avoid one country's technical, ethical, or manufacturing regulations, while continuing .........?
            * ......?
            * ......?
        * Problems and Side Effects
            * Companies that do this may eventually have to answer to social standards
            * increased domestic unemployment rate (at least, initially)
            * Foreign workers may be trained to the same standards as domestic workers, but its hard to tell, until they're hired
            * Increased demands for cheap, high-skilled workers can force domestic salaries to drop, causing future business problems
    * Onshoring
        * When a foreign company employs workers in a domestic location
            * The US onshored 5% of foreign technology jobs in 2005
            * That number has been slowly rising, to 7% in 2015
            * Moral: *Evidence shows we're okay with Onsharing*

        * Makes an exception for systems that a company owns, such as computers, cell phones, pagers, or other devices
