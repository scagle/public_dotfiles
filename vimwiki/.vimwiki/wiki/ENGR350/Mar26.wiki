= Hacktivism =
    * Justifiable - The good outweighs the bad
        * Not necessarily legal
    * Hacktivism: Hacker activism
    * Modern Terminology of hacking
        * Hacking: accessing stuff you don't have access to
    * Past Terminology
        * In the 1960's and 1970's
            * Hacking was a positive term
            * A "hacker" was any creative programmer who wrote code to extend functionality - we just call them developers now
            * The "Hack" was always meant to do good
            * the hacker was honest, unmotivated by money and careful not to harm anyone
            * In some circles, hacking is still reserved for clever coding (CSS hacks are scripts that seek to make the internet cross browser friendly)
        * In the 1970s and 1980s
            * Hacking began taking on negative connotations
                * Described indivduals breaking into computers they weren't authorized to access
                * Included the spereading of computer worms and viruses and "Phone phreaking"
                * Companies began hiring crimnal hackers to analyze and improve security (though some did so illicitly)
                * During this time, all hacks were done entirely by people writing code by hand.
        * In the mid 1990s
            * The WWW changed how hacking was done
                * Viruses and womrs could be spread rapidly
                * Programs were written to inject code auto-magically
            * Hacktivism surfaced
            * DoS attacks became more prominent
            * Personal and financial theft online grew rapidly
    * As CyberTechnology improves and innovation grows:
        * Defining ehtical boundaries becomes more difficult
        * AND
        * Terminology develops...
    * Activism
        * Use of physical space or platform to support a social/polictical caues - this type of protest is protected by law
            * An activist could use the internet to discuss issues, from groups, plan activities and coordinate meetings
            * Activists commonly set up blogs, monitor public forums or gather public information, then "take it to the streets"
            * Lately, we've seen Facebook and Twitter become very active activist tools.
        * Civil Rights Movement with MLK basically made the ground work for activist laws
    * Can Activism be justified?
    * Is it Legal?
    * To be legal, activism must fall under Civil Disobedience
        * Civil Disobedience must:
            * Cause no damage to persons or property
            * Be nonviolent
            * Not seek personal profit
            * Be ethically motivated for the common good
            * Be willing to accept responsibility and consequences for outcome of protest
    * Hacktivism is also known as "political hacking"
        * Use of hacking to promote a political cause 
        * Seeks to disrupt normal operations of a website or service, but without causing major damages
        * Often times, the damages are unknown or present themselves at a later time
    * Is Hacktivism legal? NO NEVER
        * Hacktivism defaces property, requires repairs, could seek profit and often goes unpunished, so it violates criteria for civil disobedience
        * As of now, hacktivism is never legal, and often deemed CyberTerrorism
    * Does that mean hacktivism can never be justified?
        * Not exactly... It's complicated

= CyberTerrorism =
    * Covers political hacking intended to cause "grave harm"
        * Loss of life
        * Severe economic loss
    * Typically  .....

= Hacking or CyberTerrorism? =
    * Anonymous & "Operation Payback"
    * Targeted commercial and government websites that supported PIPA and SOPA
        * Most other protesters were non-disruptive while making their political views known (Wikipedia and Google displayed a banner on pages, but allowed content to be viewed)
        * Anonymous launched DoS attacks against the sites instead causing monetary damage and loss of access
