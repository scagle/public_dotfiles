= Block Chain = 
    * Something that not a lot of people know how it works
    * Bitcoin is the first major block chain
    - Background
        * Bitcoin came about after the recession around 2008
        * Databases used to only exist in one place
            * People/Person who invented bitcoin thought that was dumb
            * They wanted distributed databases
    - Description
        * Block Chain is just a distributed ledger system
        * We don't know who the bitcoin creators were, but they built a damn good system
        * Bitcoin hasn't been compromised ONCE
            * Exchanges have been compromised but not bitcoin itself
        - *Node*
            * Bit coin mining machines are called nodes (millions)
            * Often times they use GPUs to compute computations for Bitcoins
            * That's why GPU's are so damn expensive right now
                * GPU's are better pound for pound
                * GPU's are great at parallel processing
        - *Master Node*
            * Bit coin server that just organizes nodes, and compares the numbers to the actual key
            * Moderators essentially, make sure that everyone plays fair
        * What does it mean to mine bitcoin
            * There are a shit ton of master nodes (~thousand's)
            * Whenever somebody wants to mine, they send a message to the master node
            * The master node sends back a message with a part of the overall transaction
            * When you make a bitcoin transaction you have the:
                * Bitcoin Addresses
                * Miners Fee - Like money in the pot in blackjack
                * Timestamp
                * How much was traded
            * Essentially there are _*no personal information involved with mining bitcoin*_
            * The Nodes are just trying to guess the decryption key for these transactions
            * *RULES*
                * New key per transaction
                * No two keys can be the same
            * When bitcoin first started the keys were small (IE 0-99)
            * Now the digits are in the range of 1 x 10^29 (100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) 
        * If you try to change your bitcoin key then that key in itself will easily be invalidated
            * Like super advanced parity or something like that (NOT SURE)
        * Halving system
            * Every six months or so, the miners fee gets split in half
            * Nodes have less incentive to stay in the game these days, because the payout is so small
    - Where should you bitcoin mine?
        * Some place where its naturally cold
        * Some place where power is super cheap
        * Some place where power regulations are minimal
        * So basically some cabin in the snowy mountains of Russia...
        * Cheap power = things like coal power = bad for environment
        * *Bit Coin can be non-environmentally friendly, because it requires cheap power to be profitable*_
    - Block Chains
        * A chain of blocks of 2MB that everyone can access, because it's so small
        * Advantages
            * Secure
            * Modularized
            * Automation
        * Disadvantages
            * Energy Use
            * Anonymous
            * Time it takes
    - Why does IBM and Tesla and other companies want to use Block Chains
        * Security
        * Tesla car might see a tree in the road, and the car will communicate to
