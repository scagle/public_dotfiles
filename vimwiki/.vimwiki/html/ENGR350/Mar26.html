During this time, all hacks were done entirely by people writing code by hand.

</ul>
<li>
Activism

</ul>
<li>
Can Activism be justified?

<li>
Is it Legal?

<li>
To be legal, activism must fall under Civil Disobedience

<ul>
<li>
Civil Disobedience must:

<ul>
<li>
Cause no damage to persons or property

<li>
Be nonviolent

<li>
Not seek personal profit

<li>
Be ethically motivated for the common good

<li>
Be willing to accept responsibility and consequences for outcome of protest

</ul>
</ul>

Hacktivism is also known as "political hacking"

<ul>
<li>
Use of hacking to promote a political cause

Seeks to disrupt normal operations of a website or service, but without causing major damages

<li>
Often times, the damages are unknown or present themselves at a later time

<ul>
<li>
Hacktivism defaces property, requires repairs, could seek profit and often goes unpunished, so it violates criteria for civil disobedience

<li>
As of now, hacktivism is never legal, and often deemed CyberTerrorism

</ul>
<li>
Does that mean hacktivism can never be justified?

<ul>
<li>
Not exactly... It's complicated
