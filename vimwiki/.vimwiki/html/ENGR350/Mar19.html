<div id="Block Chain"><h1 id="Block Chain">Block Chain</h1></div>
<ul>
<li>
Something that not a lot of people know how it works

<li>
Bitcoin is the first major block chain

<li>
Background

<ul>
<li>
Bitcoin came about after the recession around 2008

<li>
Databases used to only exist in one place

<ul>
<li>
People/Person who invented bitcoin thought that was dumb

<li>
They wanted distributed databases

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Description

<ul>
<li>
Block Chain is just a distributed ledger system

<li>
We don't know who the bitcoin creators were, but they built a damn good system

<li>
Bitcoin hasn't been compromised ONCE

<ul>
<li>
Exchanges have been compromised but not bitcoin itself

</ul>
<li>
<span id="Block Chain-Node"></span><strong id="Node">Node</strong>

<ul>
<li>
Bit coin mining machines are called nodes (millions)

<li>
Often times they use GPUs to compute computations for Bitcoins

<li>
That's why GPU's are so damn expensive right now

<ul>
<li>
GPU's are better pound for pound

<li>
GPU's are great at parallel processing

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
<span id="Block Chain-Master Node"></span><strong id="Master Node">Master Node</strong>

<ul>
<li>
Bit coin server that just organizes nodes, and compares the numbers to the actual key

<li>
Moderators essentially, make sure that everyone plays fair

</ul>
<li>
What does it mean to mine bitcoin

<ul>
<li>
There are a shit ton of master nodes (~thousand's)

<li>
Whenever somebody wants to mine, they send a message to the master node

<li>
The master node sends back a message with a part of the overall transaction

<li>
When you make a bitcoin transaction you have the:

<ul>
<li>
Bitcoin Addresses

<li>
Miners Fee - Like money in the pot in blackjack

<li>
Timestamp

<li>
How much was traded

</ul>
<li>
Essentially there are <em><span id="Block Chain-no personal information involved with mining bitcoin"></span><strong id="no personal information involved with mining bitcoin">no personal information involved with mining bitcoin</strong></em>

<li>
The Nodes are just trying to guess the decryption key for these transactions

<li>
<span id="Block Chain-RULES"></span><strong id="RULES">RULES</strong>

<ul>
<li>
New key per transaction

<li>
No two keys can be the same

</ul>
<li>
When bitcoin first started the keys were small (IE 0-99)

<li>
Now the digits are in the range of 1 x 10^29 (100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) 

</ul>
<li>
If you try to change your bitcoin key then that key in itself will easily be invalidated

<ul>
<li>
Like super advanced parity or something like that (NOT SURE)

</ul>
<li>
Halving system

<ul>
<li>
Every six months or so, the miners fee gets split in half

<li>
Nodes have less incentive to stay in the game these days, because the payout is so small

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Where should you bitcoin mine?

<ul>
<li>
Some place where its naturally cold

<li>
Some place where power is super cheap

<li>
Some place where power regulations are minimal

<li>
So basically some cabin in the snowy mountains of Russia...

<li>
Cheap power = things like coal power = bad for environment

<li>
<span id="Block Chain-Bit Coin can be non-environmentally friendly, because it requires cheap power to be profitable"></span><strong id="Bit Coin can be non-environmentally friendly, because it requires cheap power to be profitable">Bit Coin can be non-environmentally friendly, because it requires cheap power to be profitable</strong>_

</ul>
<li>
Block Chains

<ul>
<li>
A chain of blocks of 2MB that everyone can access, because it's so small

<li>
Advantages

<ul>
<li>
Secure

<li>
Modularized

<li>
Automation

</ul>
<li>
Disadvantages

<ul>
<li>
Energy Use

<li>
Anonymous

<li>
Time it takes

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Why does IBM and Tesla and other companies want to use Block Chains

<ul>
<li>
Security

<li>
Tesla car might see a tree in the road, and the car will communicate to 

</ul>
</ul>
