Midterm on next tuesday

<div id="Review"><h1 id="Review">Review</h1></div>
<ul>
<li>
We talked about regulations before

<li>
Why would we hate regulations

<ul>
<li>
Warranties, Net Neutrality, Consumer Annoyances 

</ul>
<li>
Why would we like regulations

<ul>
<li>
Safety, Quality, Profit, Simplification

</ul>
<li>
Usually regulations = restrictions, which may be good or bad

</ul>
<div id="Network Neutrality"><h1 id="Network Neutrality">Network Neutrality</h1></div>
<ul>
<li>
Why we don't have NN now

<li>
What is NN?

<li>
Today's goal it to take away some confusion

<li>
What is the internet?

<ul>
<li>
We can't really define it to somebody 100 years ago, since you can't 
          describe it without using computer jargon, of which there was none of at the time

</ul>
<li>
Regulation 

<ul>
<li>
Purposes

<ul>
<li>
Safety

<li>
Transparency

<li>
User perception

</ul>
<li>
Self-regulation

<li>
Regulationg cyberspace

<ul>
<li>
Well the internet really isn't a company... it's a media

<li>
Not owned by any one part

<li>
Tricky

<li>
You can find/do just about anything online

<li>
How do we begin conversation about how internet can be regulated

<li>
First we need to look to the past

</ul>
<li>
Traditional Media Regulation

<ul>
<li>
FCC - regulates broadcast, print, cable, or circulation of any type of media

<li>
Traditionally there have been 3 main types of media

<ul>
<li>
Print media - Books, newspapers, magazines, leaflets, comics 

<ul>
<li>
Anything you can physically hold in a store/buy

<li>
Regulated by things like publishers

<ul>
<li>
Publishers act as your lawyers / advertisers / editors / content-regulators / printers

</ul>
<li>
FCC regulates all the publishers

</ul>
<li>
Broadcast Media

<ul>
<li>
Radio - Radio AM/FM, Television

<li>
FCC regulates frequencies / bad language / reputation

</ul>
<li>
Common Carriers

<ul>
<li>
Telephone Companies

<li>
Cable Companies

<ul>
<li>
People who come in a put in place pipes / cables into your home

</ul>
<li>
Public Utilities that anyone can have access to

<ul>
<li>
Water / Electric / Gas

</ul>
<li>
(they serve the general public without discrimination)

</ul>
<li>
Where does the internet fall in all of this?

<ul>
<li>
Kinda in all 3, but Kinda not in all 3

</ul>
<li>
So how does regulation work within the 3

<ul>
<li>
Aims to protect children

<li>
Restrictions based on rating systems (G, PG, R, X, ...)

<li>
Different 'tiers' of protection (premium channels allow some regulated content to be shown, but you got to pay extra)

<li>
Allows equal opportunities to advertise, regardless of content

<li>
Project against illegal content

<li>
You're not allowed to discriminate advertisers

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Who does the regulating

<ul>
<li>
Federal Communications Commissions (FCC)

<li>
Their main goal is to:

<ul>
<li>
"make available so far as possible, to all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of 
                  race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and world-wide wire and radio 
                  communication services with adequate facilities at reasonable costs"

<li>
Make sure people/advertisers aren't discriminated by anything

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Cyberspace as a mediu

<ul>
<li>
Should the internet itself be classified as a common carrier?

<ul>
<li>
Well, not really... the internet doesn't really fit into the 3 traditional media types

<li>
But, companies that provide internet service can be considered common carriers, which means they can be regulated

<li>
So should they be?

</ul>
<li>
Lets look through some history to see

</ul>
<li>
A bit of history

<ul>
<li>
1996 - Telecommunications act

<ul>
<li>
Says telecom companies (ISPs) can compete how they see fit.

<li>
pretty much allowed ISPs to create monopolies

<li>
Allowed gerrymandering of cable coverage in neighborhoods

</ul>
<li>
2003 - term "Network Neutrality"

<ul>
<li>
Some ISPs were banning the use of VPNs through their networks

<li>
and some weren't allowing users to use their own WiFi routers

</ul>
<li>
2005 - ISP Madison River was blocking internet phone calls on their network

<ul>
<li>
FCC fines them and bans this sort of blocking

<li>
Supreme Court rules that ISPs will not be regulated by the FCC

<li>
FCC says ISP needs to be regulated, ISP's were saying that they aren't common carriers
                  and ISP's cite Telecommunications Act of 1996.

</ul>
<li>
2008 - Comcast found to be blocking BitTorrent connections on its network

<ul>
<li>
FCC orders them to stop

<li>
Comcast sues the FCC and wins

</ul>
<li>
2008 - Apple gets caught blocking all desktop Skype calls calls at the request of AT&amp;T

<ul>
<li>
This happened directly after Microsoft buys Skype

<li>
FCC threatens to sue and the blocking stops

</ul>
<li>
2010 - Streaming websites and appliations (gamers/netflix/hulu/football/etc) really take wind

<ul>
<li>
Companies lacked the infastructure to support the sudden onslaught of streamers

<li>
Companies panicked and started banning gamers from networks

</ul>
<li>
2010 - FCC passes "Open Internet Order"

<ol>
<li>
ISP's must be transparent about how they handle network congestion

<li>
ISP's must prohibit blocking of traffic

<li>
ISP's must ban unreasonable discrimination

</ol>
<li>
2010 - Verizon Sues FCC for overstepping their bounds

<ul>
<li>
Open Internet Order is removed

</ul>
<li>
2012 - Class action lawsuit against AT&amp;T for blocking FaceTime for users without a mobile share plan

<ul>
<li>
Petition to AT&amp;T saying that they are not happy and are about to leave

<li>
AT&amp;T promptly stops the blocking, as to keep their userbase

</ul>
<li>
2014 - Comcast begins charging Netflix a monthly fee

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAxMyTwmu_M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAxMyTwmu_M</a>

<ul>
<li>
Net Neutrality in the US: Now what?

</ul>
<li>
This fee is imposed on content providers that use a lot of bandwidth

<li>
Last Week Tonight thing happened - and jumpstarted a movement

<li>
4 million+ people write to FCC (most in history)

<li>
Lots of tech companies start supporting Net Neutrality ideas

<li>
Obama calls for reclassification of the internet as a utility (common carrier)

</ul>
<li>
*2015 - FCC passes Network Neutrality for the first time

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/video/technology/100000002881329/how-net-neutrality-works.html">http://www.nytimes.com/video/technology/100000002881329/how-net-neutrality-works.html</a>

<li>
Prevents "the blocking or prioritizing of any legal internet traffic

<li>
No more ISPs charging content providers to unlock speeds

</ul>
<li>
2017 - FCC changes its mind and removes Net Neutrality rules

<ul>
<li>
This means ISPs have more control over traffic on their networks

</ul>
<li>
2018 - The following states passed their own versions of Net Neutrality

<ul>
<li>
Washington 

<li>
Oregon

<li>
California

<li>
New Jersey

<li>
(Another one)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Taking Sides

<ul>
<li>
ISP side

<ul>
<li>
ISPs say that some content providers like Netflix and other streaming companies account 60% or more of all bandwidth

<ul>
<li>
Without NN laws, they can charge those streaming copanies extra money to serve that streaming content

<li>
They could technically also charge end users premium fees to unlock certain bandwidth allowances

<li>
They can then use that money to improve their network infrastructure and provide better internet to everyone

</ul>
<li>
ISP's say there aren't any anti-monopoly laws for content providers so NN seems to be unfair

<ul>
<li>
Seems like monopolies form in different ways, though

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Historically content providers like Google, Netflix, Microsoft, HBO... generally like NN

<ul>
<li>
They won't need to pay extra money just to have content served as normal

<li>
They can then put morem oney into their content and focus on better quality

</ul>
<li>
But lately, even companies like Netflix and Google seem to be oka without Net Neutrality

<ul>
<li>
They're already "big enough to get the deals we want"

<li>
Fewer startups can compete, because they just don't have the money to

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
But what about public internet access?

<ul>
<li>
School Computers

<li>
Library Access

<li>
Public Wifi

<li>
Private Networks

<li>
Content can still be blocked to these access points, but only through personal firewalls

<ul>
<li>
The ISP must allow all lawful content to be accessed from the provider - after that, it can be blocked on private networks

</ul>
<li>
So CSULB blocking bit-torrent has nothing to do with this, guys

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
