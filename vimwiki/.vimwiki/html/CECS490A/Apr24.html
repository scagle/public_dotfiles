<ul>
<li>
Grading guideline on the website

<li>
Gantt Charts

<ul>
<li>
We will have to have one in report

</ul>
<li>
2 Submissions

<ul>
<li>
Team Report

<li>
Individual Report

<ul>
<li>
2-3 Paragraphs 1 page

<li>
Not double spaced

<li>
Work that you did, work that they did, etc.

<li>
Confidential

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Team Report Breakdown: <em><span id="Final Report-Order doesn't really matter here"></span><strong id="Order doesn't really matter here">Order doesn't really matter here</strong></em>

<ul>
<li>
Lots of things carried over from midterm report

<ul>
<li>
Name, etc.

</ul>
<li>
Project Implementation

<ul>
<li>
Go into more detail compared to last time.

<li>
All holes should be answered

<li>
Plausible mechanism for solving problems

</ul>
<li>
Subcomponent Descriptions

<ul>
<li>
Understanding functionality of subcomponent

<ul>
<li>
IE: Bluetooth functionality, H-Bridge functionality, Stepper Controller functionality

<li>
Data Sheets

<li>
Understanding PWM / Duty Cycles / High Low Voltage / Direction

<li>
Really take the time to detail each component you're using and how they work

</ul>
<li>
It's the only way Hernandez knows we know what we're working with as apposed to just grabbing stuff online 

<li>
EX: He had a report that was sparse and C at best

<ul>
<li>
They met all requirements of the final report

<li>
But they had like 1 sentence for the subcomponent descriptions, which was not good

<li>
So take time here to incorporate all important concepts

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Overall System Functional Block Diagram or Diagrams

<ul>
<li>
Block diagram is pretty similar to previous overall block system diagram

<li>
Showing each connection between modules

<li>
Each module has a diagram that labels every single pin (GPIO, ANALOG IN, PWM, etc)

<li>
Voltage level table

<li>
Current Requirements (If a component is sinking like 1 Amp, you'll want to know that)

<ul>
<li>
If there's a high impedance something, then you can get away with &lt;1mA

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Complete Schematic

<ul>
<li>
Designed in a schematic program

<li>
He wants a COMPLETE schematic, of pretty much everything

<li>
BAD EXAMPLE: A lot of times he end's up seeing a schematic for one part in particular, and it's not enough

<li>
EX: If you purchase a BNO055 you'll get a development board, not just the chip

<ul>
<li>
Other manufacturers have made the development board for it

<li>
We wouldn't need to remake the entire schematic for the BNO055

<ul>
<li>
We would only need to put the part in with its connections

</ul>
<li>
However we will need to include the full schematic of the external parts as a reference

</ul>
<li>
HOWEVER, we must include a schematic of the microcontroller or FPGA in our full schematic

<ul>
<li>
Look up schematic for TM4C123G launchpad

<ul>
<li>
We need the bare minimum for the TM4C123G microcontroller. We don't need everything

<li>
IE: JTAG for programming, Reset circuit, Crystal Oscillator circuit, decoupling caps, power, etc.

<li>
<span id="Final Report-Only need to use the minimum necessary components for a functioning TM4C"></span><strong id="Only need to use the minimum necessary components for a functioning TM4C">Only need to use the minimum necessary components for a functioning TM4C</strong>

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Power Management

<ul>
<li>
Everything that's needed for power

<li>
Power Supply

<li>
Battery discharge chart, minimum amount before power supply cuts off

</ul>
<li>
Circuit Simulations and Verification

<ul>
<li>
We will need some stuff to build confidence in our design, and that it will actually work

<li>
Circuit verification

<li>
Software verification

<li>
Simulate in proper circuit modeling software

<li>
We will want a couple of these in report at end

<ul>
<li>
Screen shots of simulations

<li>
Pictures of operation

</ul>
<li>
If you're having trouble with finding things to verify, then contact Hernandez and he'll help out

</ul>
<li>
Grading guidelines

<ul>
<li>
Things that are not right, complete, or missing entirely will screw us over
