IMPORTANT

<li>
EX: 

<ul>
<li>
Greatest machine ever produced by human kind is Saturn 5 rocket for apollo launches

<li>
Incredible piece of machinery

<li>
But suddenly wasn't produced anymore, since moon landings lost interest

<ul>
<li>
Nobody was maintaining it anymore

<li>
Tribal knowledge got older, the engineers started to disappear, and knowledge was lost

</ul>
<li>
What's the rocket that NASA is currently working on?

<ul>
<li>
It's on par with the Saturn 5, on does very similar things

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Can we create something that is sustainable and maintainable for future purposes

</ul>

<li>
We want Low Power

<li>
32-bit better for computation

<ul>
<li>
ARM

</ul>
<li>
8-bit better for power

<ul>
<li>
PIC/Atmega

<li>
32 bit has 4x more transistors than an 8-bit

</ul>
<li>
Hernandez used a Microchip PIC processor

<ul>
<li>
Figure out a development system on it. (Dev Tools)

<ul>
<li>
