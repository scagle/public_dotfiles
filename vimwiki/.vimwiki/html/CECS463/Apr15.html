Z-Transform and inverse of Z-Transform

<ul>
<li>
Look at it by inspection

"Hey look at that, this looks like some formula we have"

<ul>
<li>
z-transforms are most likely going to be in partial fractions in dsp

<li>
if you are going to do this outside of dsp class, then you wont go far with this

</ul>
<li>
Hard more formal:

<ul>
<li>
too much work for us for now

<li>
don't worry about it too much

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Partial Fraction method

<ul>
<li>
any kind of rational function can be expressed as a partial fraction expansion

<li>
I think it means split up fraction so that the numerator will be smaller than denominator (with a polynomial function on the side), so z-transform can take place

<li>
We either have a fraction already, or we want one so we massage it a bit

</ul>
<li>
Inverse z-transform example 

<ul>
<li>
We don't need to memorize each and every step of the process, but it will likely be a matlab problem with some matlab functions

<li>
He just wants to show us the process

</ul>
<li>
Matlab implementation

<ul>
<li>
[R, p, c] = residuez(b, a);

<li>
[b, a] = residuez(R, p, C);

<li>

</ul>
