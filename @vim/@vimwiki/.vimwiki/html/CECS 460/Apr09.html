<ol>
<li>
Sketch example of proj directory structure. Discuss how the structure compares to the soc flow

<ol>
<li>
Work at the (sccs, srcs, users, sim, ...) row is for chip level integration + verification

<li>
Work here is Block Level Design and Verification

</ol>
<li>
What is meant by the term "Always working model (AWM)" ? At what time in the develepmont flow is this put in place? Explain the role of the librarian regarding the AWM

<ol>
<li>
Always working model

<li>
When? Once the Project was reached an initial level of completeness- Able to run end to end simulation

<li>
What? Only Files/Scriptsss/Text fixtures/HDL that pass chip level simulations are allowed in chip level directory

<li>
Allows delierables to easily identify source of errors in design

<li>
Librarian responsible for verifying correctness before admitting into library

</ol>
<li>
When developing an "Internnaly Developed Digital Block" describe the topics that should be documented in the chip spec

<ol>
<li>
Description

<li>
Block Diagram

<li>
I/O

<li>
State Machines

<li>
Register Map

<li>
Verification

When designing with Verilog there is an error message wehn one attempts to assign a variable in two procedural blccks, one @(posedge clk) and the other @(*)
        1.Expllain what the designer is aasking the tool to do 
        Explain if the tool is able to do this and why/why not
            always @(posedge clk) -&gt; Sequential (Implement as flops)
            Always @(*) 0&gt; Combinational (implemnets as gates)
            Trying to have signal driven by .......
            Always @(*) 0&gt; Combinational (implemnets as gates)

<li>
iIn the design of the UART recieve there is a need to detect the start of a transmision. Explain the technique used to know when it is time to begin collecting data. Include how the two sidesare able to stay in sync

<ol>
<li>
No Activity (MARK)

<li>
Begin Start

<li>
Count 1/2 bit to middle of start bit

<li>
Count whole bit time to sample line

<li>
Same bit rates TX ^ RX)

<ol>
<li>
As long as  ...

</ol>
</ol>
<li>
For serail commm there is an option to include a parity bit explain how tis is generated and why one should use it

<ol>
<li>
Parity is an extra bit .......
    6.What is difference between version contorl and release control?
        Version control keeps track of fiiles
        Release control keeps track of builds

</ol>
<li>
Draw the State Transition Diagram for the UART recieve state machine

<li>
Draw the way 0x9D would should up on the TX liine with 7O1
        1.mark, start, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, parity (1), stop 

<li>
Document each state as to what function it is performing

<li>
The following documents the performance of a development team performing the development of a verification effort Please discuss how a manager couldhave used this info to help reach a successfull coclusion

<ol>
<li>
 Manager could add staff overtime to deal with behind (he could do any number of things to remedy a behind team by doing X)

</ol>
<li>
Sketch the timing diagram for the tramelblaze external interface when executing the following sequence of commands

<li>
Discuss what is meant by the phrase "Requirements flow odwn, Accountability flows up"

<ol>
<li>
Each subsystem is a ____ of a system. Each system ....
