<ul>
<li>
We do get 7000 dollars as a class for funding that is not guaranteed, but probably 

<ul>
<li>
If we need something by june, we should do it before then, because funding doesn't carry over into next semester

</ul>

Our Idea Critiques

<ul>
<li>
Turret Robot

<ul>
<li>
We need to make sure we know where our turret is facing at any given point

<li>
3D print or not?

</ul>
<li>
Mesh Network Seat Detectors

<ul>
<li>
It becomes interesting when you have multiple chairs forwarding information

<li>
We should look into using a strain/flex sensor

</ul>

Tips

<ul>
<li>
We need a level of sophistication/complexity of computing that we would expect as a Computer Engineer

<ul>
<li>
We don't want to press a button and start a motor, we want something more than that.

</ul>
<li>
FPGA's are always an additional layer of complexity that is welcome into a project

<li>
Human Interaction is a big thing in robotics

<ul>
<li>
Children/Special-needs interactions

</ul>
<li>
Robots have to have a frame of reference as to where it is

<li>
Underwater Bots

<ul>
<li>
Extremely difficult to water proof a robotic platform

<li>
Communication underwater is difficult

<li>
Welding/Tubing/Plexiglass required

</ul>
<li>
Make sure we can work on these things without too much location requirements

<ul>
<li>
Drones can't fly on campus, you have to meet somewhere, very difficult to work with

</ul>
</ul>
