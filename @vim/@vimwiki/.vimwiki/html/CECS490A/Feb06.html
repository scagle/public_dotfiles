<div id="Types of connections"><h1 id="Types of connections">Types of connections</h1></div>
<ul>
<li>
Breadboard

<ul>
<li>
Great for prototyping, not great for final products

</ul>
<li>
Point-Point Soldering

<ul>
<li>
Perfboard/Protoboard

<li>
VectorBoard

</ul>
<li>
Through hole 

<ul>
<li>
Components that fit through a pcb and are soldered on the other side

</ul>
<li>
Surface mounted devices

<ul>
<li>
Useful and very small

</ul>
<li>
Wirewrapping

<ul>
<li>
Tight connections in small space, but a little effort

</ul>
<li>
PCB - Printed circuit board

<ul>
<li>
Final designs, expensive, but super solid/compact/professional

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Circuit Board Design"><h1 id="Circuit Board Design">Circuit Board Design</h1></div>
<ul>
<li>
In our projects, in our reports, we need a schematic

<ul>
<li>
People in the past have tried LTSpice

<ul>
<li>
This is more for simulation and modeling

<li>
For modeling circuits and verifying that they are going to work

</ul>
<li>
PCB Creation Software

<ul>
<li>
For documenting a schematic

<li>
For multiple engineers to look at the same documentation

<li>
For reports

<li>
For eventually creating a circuit board

<li>
Groups:

<ul>
<li>
Hobbyist

<ul>
<li>
Kicad

<li>
Eagle (used to be professional, now on it's way out)

<li>
EasyPCB123 (horrible according to eric hernandez

</ul>
<li>
Professional

<ul>
<li>
Orcad 

<ul>
<li>
Great

<li>
Older clunky interface

<li>
Libraries are going to have outdated parts

<li>
You might need to create components like tm4c1233gh6pm

<li>
You can import libraries, but:

<ul>
<li>
because orcad libraries are professional, they have mostly industry parts

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Mentor Graphics

<ul>
<li>
Staple that has been around for so long

<li>
Ugly interface

<li>
Old engineers don't want to change

<li>
But backend is amazing 

<ul>
<li>
Can find a TON of issues in the pcb design

<li>
Has great algorithms to find problems

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Altium

<ul>
<li>
Easy interface 

<li>
Easy to use

<li>
Pretty good library

<li>
Expensive

<li>
Kind've an Apple company where they don't listen to userbase

</ul>
<li>
Altium/Circuit Maker

<ul>
<li>
Circuit maker is the free version of Altium essentially

<li>
Pretty darn good

<li>
Has a couple caveats

<ul>
<li>
Public domain designs, nothing is private

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
PCB Creation Steps

<ul>
<li>
Schematic Entry

<ul>
<li>
After schematic you take that design and turn it into a physical representation of your pcb

</ul>
<li>
Layout + Routing

<li>
Generate Output

<li>
Gerbers

<ul>
<li>
Gerber -&gt; PCB fabrication house -&gt; your home in 2 weeks as blank pcb

</ul>
<li>
Soldering components to blank pcb

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
