    * DSP (Digitial Signal Processing)
        * You can do it anywhere and change it with software
            * You don't need complex hardware
        * Stable
        * Low Cost
        * Modified in real time
        * Doesn't work well with high frequency
    * ASP (Analog Signal Processing)
        * 
    * Signal Analysis 
        * Target Detection, Verification, Recognition
        * Spectrum (Frequency/Phase) analysis
        * Getting information that we want out of signal
    * Signal Filtering
        * Signal-in-Signal-out Filter
        * Eliminate noise
        * Isolating important information
        * Separation of frequency bands
        
= Matlab Overview =
    * There are three main elements to MATLAB
        * Numbers
        * Variables
        * Operators
    * NOT is ~ instead of !
    * Matrices 
        * Addition:      Straightforward 
        * Conjugation:   all imaginary parts are negated
        * Transposition: Every row becomes column and vice versa
    * Comments = %
    * Indexing Operations
        * x = [a :  b  : c] from a to c with incrementts b (+/-)
        * x = [1 : 0.1 : 2] = [1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, ... 2]
        * B = A(2:4, 3:6)
    * Control Flow
        * if elseif else end
            if condition1
                command1
            elseif condition2
                command2
            else condition3
                command3
            end
