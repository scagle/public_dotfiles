<ul>

  All of us

We'll be working with data that can potent violate norm priv

<li>
We'll be dealing with sys that the masses rely on to store personal data

Some of us will manage systems that speak directly to the safely of theose using them.

We'll be responsible for building, maintaining, and supporting systems that people rely on

<div id="3 Types of Errors and Failures"><h1 id="3 Types of Errors and Failures">3 Types of Errors and Failures</h1></div>
<ul>
<li>
(Order matters, snowball affect) 

<li>
problems for individuals

<ul>
<li>
Professional errors that incovienience individ or groups of individuals

<li>
Generally, these are the least severe types of errors, though they can have lasting Affects

<ul>
<li>
People who recieve false bills online.

<li>
Those who have incorrect data collected and stored in a database, sometimes without their knowledge.

<li>
Those who have inheritied a false sense of reality, based on their online habits.

<li>
Many problems for individuals can cause major damages - and often violate Normative Privacy or Positive Rights

<ul>
<li>
Social media platforms that don't allow people to control their own data

<li>
Swatting... 'nuff said!

<li>
Data mishaps (data that is wrongly merged or associated with unrelated data)

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
               
<ul>
<li>
It is virtually impossible to produce a major program or system with absolutely no problems

<li>
And sometimes these problems can affect many peoples and can be hard to fix

<li>
What are our professional responsibilites when we cause Problems for Individuals?

</ul>
<li>
system failures

<ul>
<li>
Professional errors that cuase either parital or complete failures and can't be fixed

<li>
Some system failures stem simply from a lack of testing a system before implementation

<ul>
<li>
$125 million Mars Climate Orivter (1999) disappeared when it should have gone into orbit around Mars - Metric/International vs Imperial/US Units

<li>
In April 2014 hundreds of LAX flights were cancelled due to a computer bug that crashed all air-traffic monitoring systems

</ul>
<li>
Some system errors happen simply because of increased user load without testing

<ul>
<li>
American Express lost its credit card verif system during the holiday season in 2010 and MasterCard in 2013 - all the security calls for verif overwhelmed the system

<li>
Skype went offline for 2 days for 2007 - many users rebooted their systems at the same time after an automatic Microsoft Windows update was pushed

</ul>
<li>
It is estimated that between 15% and 25% of cybertech projects are completely abandoned either just before delivery or soon after launch

<li>
Why?

<ul>
<li>
Lack of clear, defined goals and how to accomplish them

<li>
Poor communication and management between groups

<li>
Use of untested technology with unknown reliability

<li>
Scope-creep after work begins

<li>
Overconfidence in the technology itself

</ul>
<li>
Far-reaching effects can often leads to trouble with other connected systems - Mars Orbiter had a 2nd spacecraft that was rendered useless

<li>
Some system failures result from the use of Legacy Systems which don't play nicely with updated ones

<li>
What are our professional responsibilities when we cause System Failures (discuss)

</ul>
<li>
Safety-Critical Failures

<ul>
<li>
Professional errors that have the potential to injure or kill people

<li>
Usually safety-critical failures are met with legal ramifications that follow the respobisible party for a long time

<ul>
<li>
Nuclear reactors and other potentially polluting agents

<li>
Tesla crash in Florida, due to hacking the car

<li>
Hospital in Colorado shut down for 10 days due to faulty Electronic Health Record system

</ul>
<li>
Obviously, damages caused by Safety-Critical Failures can never be fuly recovered

<li>
The best way to prevent them is to build fail-safe mechanisms into the project

<li>
Let's take a close look at an example:

<ul>
<li>
Boeing 737 Max 8 Jet

<ul>
<li>
2 new planes crashed within 5 months, killing 346 people

<li>
A software issue would not allow pilots to override the fly-by-wire autopilot system during critical points in flight, and some safety systems seem to have been overlooked

<li>
Pilots were not trained well enough to understand this limitation

<li>
There is still no software fix - but all of these jets have been grounded

<li>
However, Boeing is still making these planes

</ul>
<li>
Where were the problems in the Boeing 737 Max 8

<ul>
<li>
It looks like Boeing was putting profit margins over safety, as the company may have known about these issues

<li>
Trained pilots using IPads and simple programs, rather than experience

<li>
Larger engines needed to be relocated on the plane, and software was s ...

</ul>
<li>
So who is at fault for these crashes?

<ul>
<li>
The Pilots

<li>
The Trainers

<li>
The Manufacturer

<li>
The Software Programmers

</ul>
<li>
Distinguishing Fault - 3 Types

<ul>
<li>
Responsibility

<ul>
<li>
Mostly individual fault

<li>
You accidentally screw up

<li>
Individual Guilt

<li>
Usually no legal punishment

</ul>
<li>
Liability

<ul>
<li>
Mostly Team Fault

<li>
Your team pushes production code that causes all customers to lose stored information

<li>
Shared Guilt

<li>
Usually is some form of legal punishment

</ul>
<li>
Accountability

<ul>
<li>
Corporate/Team Fault

<li>
Your team designed a vehicle without a fail-safe system in place (you need to answer for it)

<li>
Shared Guilt

<li>
Always lots of legal punishment

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Great - How do we avoid all of this?

<ul>
<li>
<span id="3 Types of Errors and Failures-Before a project gets underway, we must first assess the social, political, and ethical risk involved throughout the life of any project"></span><strong id="Before a project gets underway, we must first assess the social, political, and ethical risk involved throughout the life of any project">Before a project gets underway, we must first assess the social, political, and ethical risk involved throughout the life of any project</strong>

<li>
Risk Assessment

<ul>
<li>
Two Groups are usually given the chance to assess the risk of any project

<li>
Engineers, Manufacturers, and Developers

<li>
Customers (or, at least, a customer sample)

</ul>
</ul>
