...(showed up late to class and missed some stuff)
</p>

<ul>
<li>
In the Real World

<ul>
<li>
<em><span id="-Generally enforced based on physical location"></span><strong id="Generally enforced based on physical location">Generally enforced based on physical location</strong></em>

<li>
Minimum drinking age

<ul>
<li>
In Italy the legal drinking age is 14

<ul>
<li>
However they don't have drunk 15 years olds passed out in the streets

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Traffic Law

<ul>
<li>
The Autobahn in Germany has no speed limit

<ul>
<li>
However they have respect and low crash rates on the autobahn

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Gambling laws

<li>
Environmental regulations

<li>
Gun laws

<li>
Rights and freedoms

</ul>
<li>
The Internet is different

<ul>
<li>
Servers are often located in different countries or regions than website visitors

<li>
We might not even know where the server is located, or where an Internet company is registered

<li>
We can generally explore the web under protection of anonymity

<li>
We can spoof our IP addresses to look like we're physically in another place

</ul>
<li>
US Internet Laws

<ul>
<li>
some laws that we don't really have to know...

<li>
Way too many to explore

<li>
California has way more than any state

<li>
1992 AOL ISP came along

<li>
Telecommunications act of 1996

<li>
US stopped passing laws in around 2005

<li>
A lot of tech companies were probably lobbying for politicians to support certain corporate stuff

<li>
Lots of lawmakers didn't really know what they were doing

<li>
Net Neutrality

<ul>
<li>
We had it... Then not... Then did it again... Now we don't

<li>
A few states implemented their own Network Neutrality laws, but its all highly debatable ...

<li>


</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Things are starting to change

<ul>
<li>
Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect Intellectual Property Act - SOPA &amp; PIPA

<ul>
<li>
These laws were never passed in the US

<li>
But they would have changed the way copyrights would have been protected online.

<li>
It wouldn't have been good for big tech companies and activities like torrenting or posting 
              copywritten content online would have been punishable by law

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
What is the European Union?

<ul>
<li>
EU - General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR (2018)

<ul>
<li>
Puts regulations on companies and organizations holding the personal data of any EU citizen

<li>
Applies regardless of the company/organization's location

<li>
All EU citizens must be able to control all of their data, and includes the right to be forgotten

<li>
Also known as the "EU Cookie Law"

<li>
Fines up to 20 million euros will be issued for non-compliance

</ul>
<li>
EU - GAFA (since 2014)

<ul>
<li>
Stands for Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple

<li>
Where the US traditionally seeks to protect their largest companies, the EU and other regions 
              take a more neutral stance on these types of companies

<li>
Involves tax issues, privacy violations and a general concern about EU data being held in the US

<li>
Currently the EU has more Internet users than the US (433 million vs 242 million)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
How are US Companies Reacting?

<ul>
<li>
A few US companies are simply blocking some EU users from their services

<li>
But, that isn't really practical for most companies... What, is Google just gonna block 433 million users?

<li>
And, the EU includes 28 countries. Blocking them all would be devastating to these companies

<li>
Some companies are just paying the hefty fines. But, that can't last forever

<li>
Spain banned twitch on a piracy

</ul>
<li>
EU Internet Laws

<ul>
<li>
Article 11 (2018)

<ul>
<li>
Also called "The link tax" - a bit of a misnomer

<li>
Requires Search engines and other sites to pay creators for snippets of news content

<li>
But there's some confusion about what counts as a snippet

</ul>
<li>
EU - Article 13 (2019)

<ul>
<li>
Also called "The Meme Ban"

<li>
Says that content platforms will be responsible for all copyright violating content posted by users

<li>
Nobody's really sure how it will all play out, once the law goes into effect next year - 
              and, each country can interpret it how they want

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Other International internet laws

<ul>
<li>
Australia passed ban on torrent sites and browser streaming

<li>
Canada 2017 targeted subscription sites that host tons of pirated content

<li>
