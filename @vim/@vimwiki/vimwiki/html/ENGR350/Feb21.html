<ul>
<li>
Evaluating and controlling trends in technology

<li>
Information, Knowledge and judgment

<ul>
<li>
Should we just trust expert information or wisdom of the crowd" judgement when we see it?

<li>
The Web is filled with false information (medical treatment, HIstorical refernece, financial dvice, political information

<li>
Search engines generally help us find content - but web sites are ranked by popularity, not by expert evaluation

</ul>
<li>
How does google show you results

<ul>
<li>
Popularity contest

<li>
Advertisements

<li>
Things you've looked up in the past

</ul>
<li>
Wikipedia

<ul>
<li>
 Written by volunteers, so some posts are biased or inaccurate

<li>
Anyone can contribute, but most choose not to

<li>
Those that do write are generally not educated in the field, but consider themselves experts, of some sort

<li>
References don't always checkout

</ul>
<li>
"Wisdom of the Crowd"

<ul>
<li>
Problems with unreliable information are not new

<li>
the web seems to magnify those problems

<li>
SEO algorithms dont take truth into consideration

<li>
Site operators are respponsible for evaluating information submitted on their sites

<ul>
<li>
 But this costs time and money and seems to be becoming lelss important... 
              (generally, our society has held that the more information we have online, the better)
    == Vulnerable Viewers ==

</ul>
<li>
Who is a vulnerable viewer online?

<ul>
<li>
Children - should be protected from certain content

<li>
Old People - the targets of many scam attempts

<li>
Less educated individuals - we're not speaking to overall education level, but knowledge about a specific topic

<li>
Anyone who will misinterpret information atleast one time (so in a sense, everyone is vulnerable)

</ul>
<li>
Computers and commmunity

<ul>
<li>
the WWW brings folks together from everywhwer

<li>
Email and the WWW provide quick and cheap ways to stay in contact

<li>
Social networking now allows deep insight into personal lives

<li>
Our communities have become somewhat gloablized

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
So what does this all mean?

<ul>
<li>
It means the world is getting smaller
    == * Digitial divide : ==

<li>
Used to refer to the separation of those who had access to tech and didnt

<li>
Now it speaks to the gap between those who have access to tech and the knowldge of how to interpret information and theose who dont

<ul>
<li>
Access and knowledge speak to:

<ul>
<li>
The know-how to use any technology

<li>
the ability (phyiscal or otherwise) to use that technology

<li>
A basic understanding of how to protect oneself online

<li>
An ability to indentify content that is not trustworthy

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Your textbook makes a great distinction with this:

<ul>
<li>
Well there seems to be a :Lamborghini Divide" in the US - I don't have one, and others do

<li>
This divide really isn't the same as the Digital Divide:

<ul>
<li>
Owning a nice car doesn't give someone an advantage over others in the same way that access to the WWW does (there are sevices that replace cars)

<ul>
<li>
The WWW gives us access to education, access to make informed decisions, access to communication, or to oversee our information

<li>
If we didn''t have access to the internet, what service would replace those things?

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Image Manipulation and the Digital Divide

<ul>
<li>
We can easily see an influence on the digital divide when we look closely at image manipulation as a medium

<ul>
<li>
Regarding:

<ul>
<li>
Movies and videos with incredibl special effects

</ul>
<li>
But people use this for deception and fraud:

<ul>
<li>
This sometimes happens without malicious intentions:

<ul>
<li>
Sometimes the diff between entertainment and deception isn't obvious

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Lets take a look at soome examples

<ul>
<li>
(pictures in lecture that shows deception)

</ul>
