Spring 16 Quiz 8?

<ul>
<li>
Allowing us to take our designs from one to another

<li>
Slew rate control: How fast an output switches

<li>
If the receiver is continuously 

<li>
<span id="Quiz Stuff-LVDS: Low voltage digital signaling"></span><strong id="LVDS: Low voltage digital signaling">LVDS: Low voltage digital signaling</strong>

<ul>
<li>
Less voltage, less power consumption

<li>
Power consumption is a big deal

<li>
Look up 26ls32 on Google

<li>
What they discovered was that all they needed to do with diff signaling 
              was measure difference between high and low

<li>
They could go down to 1.2 volts

<li>
or whatever

<li>
This allowed less power consumption

Spring 16 Quiz 7 - DFT

<ul>
<li>
JTAG: Joint Test action group

<ul>
<li>
TDI - Serial Data In, Test Data In

<li>
TDO - Test Data Out

<li>
TMS - Test Mode Select (Control/Setup interface)

<li>
TCK - Clock used to drive JTAG logic

<li>
TRST - Low? Active reset that would reset stuff

<li>
Interfaces:

<ul>
<li>
All these signals go to TAP: Test Action Port

<li>
What we want to control

</ul>
<li>
Interface that they use to drive JTAG test?

<li>
Utilized on the Boundary Scan

<ul>
<li>
TRAMEL STORY:

<ul>
<li>
If you're being blown into space, then you need JTAG to 
                      assist with manufacturing

<li>
BUT UNCLE STEVE was concerened with the added logic

<li>
So tramel tied the JTAG stuff down to ground

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
All the old processors were 30-40 pin packages

<ul>
<li>
So they would add sockets that would have all the tools

<li>
A giant cable would route back to the software debugger on computer

<li>
ICE: In Circuit Emulator

</ul>
<li>
20 years later we start using ~400 pins

<ul>
<li>
So TI built a JTAG interface inside the Chip that used serial interface to comm
                  with computer software debugger

<li>
Boundary Scan - Verify that all your parts are soldered onto board correctly 

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
What is meant by the term "scan - flop"? Sketch one

<ul>
<li>
A Flop is 

</ul>
<li>
What is full scan. When is it utilized

<ul>
<li>
All flops replaced by scan flops

<li>
Scan Flops ...

</ul>
<li>
What does ATPG stand for? When are they utilized?

<ul>
<li>
Automatic Test Pattern Generator

<li>
Software tool to generate vectors to drive Full-scan testing

<li>
You're looking for STUCK AT 1/0 faults, OPEN/SHORTED faults

</ul>
<li>
What is boundary scan?

<ul>
<li>
When scan flops are added to all i/o of device

<li>
Used when assembling circuit boards to prove there's no errors in assembly

</ul>
