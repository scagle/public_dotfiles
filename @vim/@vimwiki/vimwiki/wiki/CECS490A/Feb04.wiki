Customer Needs
    * Specifications
        * EX: Every car needs a brake 
    * Metircs and standards to which each customer need is held to.
        * EX: If car can't break fast enough then that's bad
        * Measurable
== Design Project Management ==
    1. Develop a clear detailed plan to reach the goal
        * Make sure you have set goals 
            * Dont set too unrealistic or you'll be miserable
            * Dont set too easy or you'll under deliver
    2. Work to control cost and reduce uncertainty and risk
        * Should you make your own tools?
        * Off shelf components? or your own components?
    3. Continually monitor the progres of the plan
        * Move people if needed
    4. Initiate, facilitate, and end activities
        * Maybe everybody is equal so people take turns being project manager
    5. Assess
== Terminology ==
    * Deliverable
        * Tangible components in your project
        * Guides, Manuals, Instructions, Datasheets, etc as well
    * Tasks and Subtasks
        * Definite ending to a task
        * Subtask is just broken down bits of the task
    * Events and Milestones
        * Mid points that we have in a project where we say "yes we have finished this task and it should be ready to go"
    * Manager
        * Regular progress meetings
        * Often ask what they can do to help/expedite the process
    * Budget
        * Always buy two of something
    * Stakeholder
        * Underpromise and over deliver 
        * Anyone that profits from your product
    * Customer or Sponser
        * Anyone who's specifically requesting the work to be done
        * Contracts from big companies
    * Scope
        * What is and what is not in the project
        * Superfluous details that kinda go off in tangents 
            * Not horrible, but should be avoided for the most part
== Waterfall Model == 
    * Initiating           - Converting a need to a business case
    * Planning             - develop a solution and prepare to do the work
    * Executing            - do the detailed design work and fabrication
    * Monitoring & Control - watch the project and make changes
    * Closing              - end the project
