= Embedded Communication =
    * UART / RS232
    * I2C / TWI
        * I2C: Inter Integrated Circuit Protocol
            * I2C is trademarked, so some companies use TWI instead
        * TWI: Two Wire Interface
            * Pretty much the same thing as I2C
    * SPI: Serial Peripheral Interface
    * (There's others like CAN, but we wont cover those)
== Defining the Communication Protocol ==
    * The STACK - Example 7 Layer OSI Model
        * OSI: Open Systems Interconnection
        * *OSI Model*
            7. Application Layer
                * File transfer/Email, Variables, Data
            6. Presentation Layer
                * Incoming and outgoing data from one presentation format to 
                  another (plaintext -> Encryption)
            5. Session layer
                * Starts & Stops a session of data transmission (TCP/UDP)
            4. Transport layer
                * Ensure delivery of the Entire Message (Error Checking, TCP/UDP, UART)
            3. Network layer
                * This layer handles addressing and routing the data
                * Routes data to different addresses / devices
                * iptables
                * IP is the layer
            2. Data-link layer
                * Responsible for sending a full packet
                * Determines how we assemble a packet layer from multiple bytes
                * EX: (| start byte | cmd byte | data byte 1 | data byte 2 | checksum byte |)
            1. Physical layer
                * Bit stream across network through any medium (wireless, wired, radio, IR)
    * Conceptual model that characterizes the communications functions of a computing system
      without regard to it's underlying internal structure and technology
== Specifications ==
    * Physical Layer
        * Speed
        * Distance
        * # of signals
        * # devices / addressing (make sure devices can communicate)
        * Applications
        * UART / Logic Level / TTL
