* We do get 7000 dollars as a class for funding that is not guaranteed, but probably 
    * If we need something by june, we should do it before then, because funding doesn't carry over into next semester
    
* Our Idea Critiques
    * Turret Robot
        * We need to make sure we know where our turret is facing at any given point
        * 3D print or not?
    * Mesh Network Seat Detectors
        * It becomes interesting when you have multiple chairs forwarding information
        * We should look into using a strain/flex sensor
* Tips
    * We need a level of sophistication/complexity of computing that we would expect as a Computer Engineer
        * We don't want to press a button and start a motor, we want something more than that.
    * FPGA's are always an additional layer of complexity that is welcome into a project
    * Human Interaction is a big thing in robotics
        * Children/Special-needs interactions
    * Robots have to have a frame of reference as to where it is
    * Underwater Bots
        * Extremely difficult to water proof a robotic platform
        * Communication underwater is difficult
        * Welding/Tubing/Plexiglass required
    * Make sure we can work on these things without too much location requirements
        * Drones can't fly on campus, you have to meet somewhere, very difficult to work with
