* Come up with a team name
* Team name should have to do with the project
* Will be referred by the team name this semester and next semester

= Team Report =
    * Paragraph
    * Project Overview
        * Non-technical description of project that anyone can understand
        * Drawings/diagrams
        * Who you're intending this project for
    * Customer Needs
        * Customer Needs
    * Specifications
        * Extracting the metrics that can be measured to quantify outcomes in the project
    * Similar Products
        * Give mention to other projects from other places/universities
        * Give mention to real life products
        * Establish what you're project means when compared to these others
    * Societal and Environmental Impact or Importance
        * How does the product benefit society/environment
        * Larger importance of the project
        * Consider the sustainability of product from multiple perspectives
            * IMPORTANT
            * EX: 
                * Greatest machine ever produced by human kind is Saturn 5 rocket for apollo launches
                * Incredible piece of machinery
                * But suddenly wasn't produced anymore, since moon landings lost interest
                    * Nobody was maintaining it anymore
                    * Tribal knowledge got older, the engineers started to disappear, and knowledge was lost
                * What's the rocket that NASA is currently working on?
                    * It's on par with the Saturn 5, on does very similar things
            * Can we create something that is sustainable and maintainable for future purposes
    * Product/Project Functional Description
        * Go into a lot more details about project
        * Block diagram
    * Work Breakdown Structure
    * Preliminary Component Block Diagram
    
== Work Breakdown Structure ==
    * Tool that ends up being useful for brainstorming parts of project
    * *Deliverable oriented decomposition of a project into smaller components and the key to organize the teamwork into manageable sections.*
        * Predecessor to a gantt chart
    * Fomras a Hierarchy of deliverables that need to be met
    * Think of this as a hierarchy of deliverables/goals/components
    
    * EXAMPLE: Telescope BlueTooth remote control
        * Telescope Remote
        * Instruction Manual/Datasheet
        * Packaging
        * PCB
            * Schematic
            * Layout
            * Manufactured @ PCB Fab house
        * Push Buttons
            * Debouncing
            * Sw timers/Interrupt
        * Enclosure
            * 3D Print
                * 3D Model Solid Works
                    * Button Template
                    * Battery Access
        * Power System
            * Regulated 3.3v
            * MCP1640 "Buck" Converter
            * Butt holder
            * Power Switch
            * Power LED
        * Bluetooth Module
        * Microcontroller
            * We want Low Power
            * 32-bit better for computation
                * ARM
            * 8-bit better for power
                * PIC/Atmega
                * 32 bit has 4x more transistors than an 8-bit
            * Hernandez used a Microchip PIC processor
                * Figure out a development system on it. (Dev Tools)
                    * MPLAB
                * Need a programmer/debugger
                    * ICD3
