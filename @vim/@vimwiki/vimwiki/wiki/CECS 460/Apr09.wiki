    1. Sketch example of proj directory structure. Discuss how the structure compares to the soc flow
        1. Work at the (sccs, srcs, users, sim, ...) row is for chip level integration + verification
        2. Work here is Block Level Design and Verification
    2. What is meant by the term "Always working model (AWM)" ? At what time in the develepmont flow is this put in place? Explain the role of the librarian regarding the AWM
        1. Always working model
        2. When? Once the Project was reached an initial level of completeness- Able to run end to end simulation
        3. What? Only Files/Scriptsss/Text fixtures/HDL that pass chip level simulations are allowed in chip level directory
        4. Allows delierables to easily identify source of errors in design
        5. Librarian responsible for verifying correctness before admitting into library
    3. When developing an "Internnaly Developed Digital Block" describe the topics that should be documented in the chip spec
        1. Description
        2. Block Diagram
        3. I/O
        4. State Machines
        5. Register Map
        6. Verification
    4. When designing with Verilog there is an error message wehn one attempts to assign a variable in two procedural blccks, one @(posedge clk) and the other @(*)
        1.Expllain what the designer is aasking the tool to do 
        Explain if the tool is able to do this and why/why not
            always @(posedge clk) -> Sequential (Implement as flops)
            Always @(*) 0> Combinational (implemnets as gates)
            Trying to have signal driven by .......
            Always @(*) 0> Combinational (implemnets as gates)
    5. iIn the design of the UART recieve there is a need to detect the start of a transmision. Explain the technique used to know when it is time to begin collecting data. Include how the two sidesare able to stay in sync
        1. No Activity (MARK)
        2. Begin Start
        3. Count 1/2 bit to middle of start bit
        4. Count whole bit time to sample line
        5. Same bit rates TX ^ RX)
            1. As long as  ...
    6. For serail commm there is an option to include a parity bit explain how tis is generated and why one should use it
      7. Parity is an extra bit .......
    6.What is difference between version contorl and release control?
        Version control keeps track of fiiles
        Release control keeps track of builds
    1. Draw the State Transition Diagram for the UART recieve state machine
    2. Draw the way 0x9D would should up on the TX liine with 7O1
        1.mark, start, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, parity (1), stop 
    3. Document each state as to what function it is performing
        1. SEE BEACHBOARD
    4. The following documents the performance of a development team performing the development of a verification effort Please discuss how a manager couldhave used this info to help reach a successfull coclusion
        1.  Manager could add staff overtime to deal with behind (he could do any number of things to remedy a behind team by doing X)
    2. Sketch the timing diagram for the tramelblaze external interface when executing the following sequence of commands
    3. Discuss what is meant by the phrase "Requirements flow odwn, Accountability flows up"
        4. Each subsystem is a ____ of a system. Each system ....
    6. A circuit needs to be designed that would issue a single  clock wide pulse every 1/2 second. Aassuming a 50 MHz clock with a high active reset, give the description of the design in terms of the WE THINK, WE CoMPUTE, WE WRITE, & WE GET
