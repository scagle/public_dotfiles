    * Spring 16 Quiz 8?
        * Allowing us to take our designs from one to another
        * Slew rate control: How fast an output switches
        * If the receiver is continuously 
        * *LVDS: Low voltage digital signaling*
            * Less voltage, less power consumption
            * Power consumption is a big deal
            * Look up 26ls32 on Google
            * What they discovered was that all they needed to do with diff signaling 
              was measure difference between high and low
            * They could go down to 1.2 volts
            * or whatever
            * This allowed less power consumption
    * Spring 16 Quiz 7 - DFT
        * JTAG: Joint Test action group
            * TDI - Serial Data In, Test Data In
            * TDO - Test Data Out
            * TMS - Test Mode Select (Control/Setup interface)
            * TCK - Clock used to drive JTAG logic
            * TRST - Low? Active reset that would reset stuff
            * Interfaces:
                * All these signals go to TAP: Test Action Port
                * What we want to control
            * Interface that they use to drive JTAG test?
            * Utilized on the Boundary Scan
                * TRAMEL STORY:
                    * If you're being blown into space, then you need JTAG to 
                      assist with manufacturing
                    * BUT UNCLE SAM was concerened with the added logic
                    * So tramel tied the JTAG stuff down to ground
            * All the old processors were 30-40 pin packages
                * So they would add sockets that would have all the tools
                * A giant cable would route back to the software debugger on computer
                * ICE: In Circuit Emulator
            * 20 years later we start using ~400 pins
                * So TI built a JTAG interface inside the Chip that used serial interface to comm
                  with computer software debugger
                * Boundary Scan - Verify that all your parts are soldered onto board correctly 
        * What is meant by the term "scan - flop"? Sketch one
            * A Flop is 
        * What is full scan. When is it utilized
            * All flops replaced by scan flops
            * Scan Flops ...
        * What does ATPG stand for? When are they utilized?
            * Automatic Test Pattern Generator
            * Software tool to generate vectors to drive Full-scan testing
            * You're looking for STUCK AT 1/0 faults, OPEN/SHORTED faults
        * What is boundary scan?
            * When scan flops are added to all i/o of device
            * Used when assembling circuit boards to prove there's no errors in assembly
        *
