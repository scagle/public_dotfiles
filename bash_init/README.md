## Note
Do you ever get random snippets of stuff appended or prepended to your `.bashrc`? Do those snippets happen to be proprietary snippets sometimes? Do you want to remember to go through your dotfiles everytime you update them just to make sure no proprietary information slips through the cracks which potentially violate your NDA?

_Our bash configurations deserve better._ That's why they deserve their own folder!
